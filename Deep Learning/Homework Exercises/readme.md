## 1. Fashion item recognition
Given an image of a fashion item, build a deep learning model that recognizes the fashion item. Use the Fashion-MNIST dataset to train and evaluate your models. More information about the task and the dataset can be found at https://research.zalando.com/welcome/mission/research-projects/fashion-mnist/


## 2. Bone X-Ray abnormality detection.
Given a study containing X-Ray images build a deep learning model that decides if the study is normal or abnormal. Use the MURA dataset to train and evaluate your models. More information about the task and the dataset can be found at https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/
